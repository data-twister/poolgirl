# Poolgirl

This library is a translation in Elixir of the famous poolboy : https://github.com/devinus/poolboy ... 
I just don't like to mix Erlang and Elixir code (Elixir is clearer than its father) and this library is a great one.

# Things adding compared with poolboy

* ttl to deallocate overflow workers ( see PR of poolboy )
* changing pool size dynamically

# Bugs
