# Poolgirl

This library is only a translation in Elixir of https://github.com/devinus/poolboy ... 
I just don't like to mix Erlang and Elixir code (Elixir is clearer than its father) and this library is a great one ... Nothing much ...

# Bugs
Bugs are mine and for the rest, all credits are for Devinus and his fellow maintainers of the project. Support them !
